# Crypto Driver

This is a potentially prepacked version of the BaseCryptLib and TlsLib, delivered via protocol.

There are two routes: using the precompiled version and compiling it into your platform.

## Benefits

But first, why would you care about this? 
It has a few benefits, namely:

- Smaller Binary sizes
- Easier to service/upgrade
- Transparency on what version of crypto you're using
- Reduced build times (if using precompiled version)
